# Basketball-Scoreboard

I built a basketball scoreboard using html, css, and javaScript. I use HTML to structure the site and then use CSS for the styling and centering the scoreboard. For JavaScript I use dom manipulation to grab all the selectors that I needed. After that I set both the variables for home and guest to 0. I also set a true vairable for the state of the count. I used the if statement for increment. I created three functions to add 1 score, add 2 score, and add 3 score.
